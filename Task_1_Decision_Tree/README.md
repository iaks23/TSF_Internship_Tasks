## üå≥ Decision Tree Classifier

Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning (that is you explain what the input is and what the corresponding output is in the training data) 
where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter. The tree can be explained by two entities, 
namely decision nodes and leaves. The leaves are the decisions or the final outcomes. And the decision nodes are where the data is split. 

> Purpose üî≠

Given the [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) dataset to work with, we have to build a Decision Tree Classifier which will accurately predict unseen data, furthermore, we must also visualize it graphically.
